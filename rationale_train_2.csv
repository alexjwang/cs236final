"Category: physics # explanatory answer step 1 : assign variables and frame equations let jose take ' x ' days to complete the task if he worked alone . let jane take ' y ' days to complete the task if she worked alone . statement 1 of the question : they will complete the task in 20 days , if they worked together . in 1 day , jose will complete 1 / x of the task . in 1 day , jane will complete 1 / yof the task . together , in 1 day they will complete 1 / 20 of the task . therefore , 1 / x + 1 / y = 1 / 20 . . . . ( 1 ) statement 2 of the question : if jose worked alone and completed half the work and then jane takes over and completes the second half , the task will be completed in 45 days . jose will complete half the task in x / 2 days . jane will complete half the task in y / 2 days . ∴ x / 2 + y / 2 = 45 or , x + y = 90 or x = 90 - y . . . . ( 2 ) step 2 : solve the two equations and find x and y substitute the value of x as ( 90 - y ) in the first equation 1 / 90 − y + 1 / y = 1 / 20 or y 2 - 90 + 1800 = 0 . the quadratic equation factorizes as ( y - 60 ) ( y - 30 ) = 0 so , y = 60 or y = 30 . if y = 60 , then x = 90 - y = 90 - 60 = 30 and if y = 30 , then x = 90 - y = 90 - 30 = 60 . the question clearly states that jane is more efficient than jose . therefore , jane will take lesser time than jose . hence , jose will take 60 days to complete the task if he worked alone and jane will take 30 days to complete the same task . choice c # working together , jose and jane can complete an assigned task in 20 days . however , if jose worked alone and completed half the work and then jane takes over and completes the second half , the task will be completed in 45 days . how long will jose take to complete the task if he worked alone ? assume that jane is more efficient than jose ."

"Category: physics # explanatory answer a , b and c will share the amount of $ 2340 in the ratio of the amounts of work done by them . as a takes 6 days to complete the job , if a works alone , a will be able to complete 1 / 6 th of the work in a day . similarly , b will complete 1 / 8 th and c will complete 1 / 12 th of the work . so , the ratio of the work done by a : b : c when they work together will be equal to 1 / 6 : 1 / 8 : 1 / 12 multiplying the numerator of all 3 fractions by 24 , the lcm of 6 , 8 and 12 will not change the relative values of the three values . we get 24 / 6 : 24 / 8 : 24 / 12 = 4 : 3 : 2 . i . e . , the ratio in which a : b : c will share $ 2340 will be 4 : 3 : 2 . hence , c ' s share will be 2 * 2340 / 9 = 520 . correct choice is ( b ) # a , b and c , each working alone can complete a job in 6 , 8 and 12 days respectively . if all three of them work together to complete a job and earn $ 2340 , what will be c ' s share of the earnings ?"
