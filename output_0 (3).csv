we have a * fixed * distance, and we are given the difference between the times and speeds of two things that have traveled that distance. this is one of the very small number of question formats

was then s + 5, and team a's time was then 300 / ( s + 5 ). we need to find an answer choice for s so that the time of team a is 3 less than the time of team q. that is, we need an answer choice so that 300 / ( s + 5 ) = ( 300 / s ) - 3. you can now immediately use number properties to zero in on promising answer choices : the times in these questions will always work out to be integers, and we need to divide 300 by s, and by s + 5. so we want an answer choice s which is a factor of 300, and for which s + 5 is also a factor of 300. so you can rule out answers a and c immediately, since s + 5
