thanks!!! the distance of z 15 is equal to five times the distance of x 13 ( we established that x 13 is the baseline and thus, it's measurements are d, s, t ) s ( t + 2 ) = 5 ( s * t ) what clues would i have to know to set up the equation in this fashion? is it because i am better off setting two identical distances together? st + 2 s = 5 st t + 2 = 5 t 2 = 4 t t = 1 / 2 we are looking for distance ( d = s * t ) so we need to solve for speed now that we have time. speed y 14 - speed x 13 speed = d / t 3 d / t - d / t = 1000 ( remember, t is the same because both asteroids were observed for the same amount of time ) 2 d = 1000 2 = 500 d = s * t d = 500 * ( 1 / 2 ) d = 250 answer : a # т had a total length of 700 meters, an altitude of 600 meters, was observed for a asteroid, while traveling east, she took a base of distance of 600 meters. she traveled for a asteroid, then continued the same route, and finished the asteroid after she had""]","(0.84, 15.0)"
